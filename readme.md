## 窗棂: a desktop concept design in Chrome

visit the demo with Chrome: http://jiyinyiyong.github.com/chuangling/page  
run `cake dev` to develop

### Goal

Desktops should be wonderful and should carry programming environments!  
Users should have all kinds of APIs to deal with the desktop's details.  
The OS developments may give more powers to the coders.  

In the future, we may have more and more desktops placed in grids.  
It's kind like metro and what's more, we may switch among seemlessly.  
I was trying to make a real desktop beyond this demo, more nice features.  

Here an article about part of it in Chinese:

### Better written in Chinese about my goal

Linux 环境的桌面如此, 一年前甚至我最初尝试 Linux 的动力就在于此  
桌面应该有编写代码一般的自由. 我们是 Coder, 而不仅仅是用户  
我希望每天能按照自己的操作习惯改进桌面, 然而过去了两年, 我只能写 HTML 而已  
GNOME3 的高明之处在于桌面的可编程性大大提升了, 你能想到未来

我梦想中的桌面是大量的网格, 深度的嵌套, 兼容其他结构  
一年前的图纸,在底部的图片里. 动画则如视频中展示的, 嵌套和窗口我没能做出来  
我期待有一天桌面能很漂亮地排版, 很自由地切换, 并且以网页开发的难度彻底编程  
目标是有一天能用框架把自己需要的功能全用代码实现出来

### Shortcuts

`ctrl q` for view  
`ctrl m` for overview  
`ctrl b` for terminal  
`ctrl arrow` to walkaround

### Exposed APIS

run LiveScript code in the terminal, or JS in Console:

```LiveScript
ls # for LiveScript
$ # for jQuery
tmpl # accept JSON to render HTML
move-to # accept "1&-1" for example and go
move-up # as you know... also down left and right
puts # to print strings
put-clear # to clear output
resize-desktop # change the size of desktop
```

### Plan

Now it's a demo. I don't think I can make it a real stuff though.  
If anyone favor this idea, take it make it a desktop please.  

### Lisence

MIT

### the Past and the Future
